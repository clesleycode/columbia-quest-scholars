Website Documentation: 

The website is built off of Twitter’s bootstrap, mainly because it’s easy to work with and it has so many templates available online. 

The main website is www.columbia.edu/cu/questscholars/ 

As of now, the homepage has 7 tabs on the top with a picture of the quest board as the homepage. The tabs can be summarized as follows: 

About Us: Stays on the original homepage, and includes a short introduction to our chapter. It currently has three split up areas (labeled Academic, Professional, and Community Support) for us to add specifics of how example our QSN does each of those things.

Mentoring: When this tab is clicked, we’re redirected to a new page, www.columbia.edu/cu/questscholars/mentoring.html. The code for this is located in the mentoring.html file, and is currently in a blog setting. This part of the website is for all information relating to the Q-FLIP program. This is currently under construction. More info about this can be found in the next sections.

Resources: When this tab is clicked, a new page is redirected here as well, www.columbia.edu/cu/resources.html. This code is located in the resources.html file. The heading is labeled Resource Page for low-income students and will serve as a go-to for our quest students in need of information. This part is also still under construction. More can be found in the next sections.

Calendar: This part is also under construction, but will not redirect to a new page.

Events: This currently serves as a small way of showcasing events we’ve had. This is soon to be under construction as well.

Eboard: Each of the eboard’s picture, linkedin profile, email, and role can be found here. 

Contact: Includes our chapter’s Facebook, email, and instagram account information. 

CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION: 

Mentoring Tab: Right now it includes four tab, labeled “Home”, “About”, “Photos”, and “Calendar”. Jasleen Nuno is currently working on the Photos tab, where a photo gallery of pictures from our events/outings will be included.  

PLANS FOR CONSTRUCTION COMING SOON:

Calendar Tab: A calendar for our events will be added under this tab. Fairly self explanatory - the plan is to use a bootstrap plugin.

Mentoring Calendar Tab:  Same plans as our overall chapter calendar. Except some things will be excluded on this calendar. 

Resources Tab: The current content needs to be added. The HTML is all screwed up, and we need to figure out how we want the content to be displayed. Do we want “Read More” buttons? Content also needs to be added. 

Events Tab: The Events tab will be edited to include a photo gallery instead so that it’s easier to add content. This will likely be done by Jasleen Nuno since she’s currently working on a photo gallery for the mentoring program.

IDEAS TO EVENTUALLY BE ADDED:

Mentoring Office Hours Tab: We talked about plans to have office hours for our Q-FLIP mentees - this is where they would be displayed.
