                        <br>

                    </h2>
                    <p>

<b>Introduction:</b><br>
    Believe it or not, getting a research position on campus isn’t too difficult if you know the proper steps to take in getting one. With that said, many students, particularly first-generation and low-income ones, don’t know how to navigate the academic world and enter the seemingly scary world of research. Here, you can find information on not only how to get an actual research position, but also how to go about funding, getting academic credit, and many other tips. <br>

<b>Getting a Research Position:</b><br>
    Most of us who are in the research world as an undergrad are in because we did the simple but non-intuitive action of just emailing professors we’d interesting in working with. There are options beyond just “cold emailing” professors and hoping for the best, but this is definitely one that hasn’t failed many students before. With that said, let’s go over in detail how that process looks like. <br>

<b>No Research Experience? No Problem.</b><br>
    If you’re early on in your college career and have no experience in research, it may be overwhelming to find a lab/decide on what type of research you’d like to do. It’s okay, even the most experienced of us has been there at some point. Everyone has to start somewhere. In fact, <i>many professors don’t care all that much for previous experience. They care more about your ability to listen and learn, to commit to the lab, and your willingness to put the work into the research.</i> <br>
    With that being said, here’s a few points to remember:<br>
    
1. When choosing lab(s)/professor(s) to approach, look through their area of research/research website first. It’s good to have an idea of what type of research they are doing. Don’t understand about the complicated stuff on their website? That’s OKAY. If you were to join their lab, you will learn.<br>

2. Some lab(s)/professor(s) go through an interview process; I have done a couple with Columbia professors myself. It may be instinct to read every word on their research website and try to understand every research paper they have written in an attempt to show off your knowledge in their research. No. Interviews are not spaces for you to recite information from their research website word per word. They are there for you to show them your interest, your passion, and your commitment to beginning research.<br>
    
<b>Using Your Work-Study Job Smartly: </b><br>
    As students on significant amounts of financial aid, we’re nearly all required to hold a work-study job. And though it may be tempting to find a job that’s more relaxed so you can get work done, you can also use this opportunity to have your work-study job contribute to your future in a significant way. 
    So instead of taking a job with public safety or at the library, consider looking for jobs that involve research. It’s also important to note that if you check the work-study job and nothing seems to be aligned with your field of study/interest, if you find a professor willing to pay you for doing research with them during the year, you can use this to count as your work-study. <br>

<b>Academic Credit:</b><br>
    Another option you have- and perhaps the most commonly done one, is to do research for academic credit. This is dependent on the professor and what they’re willing to offer you, but it’s a great option. Not only will it show on your academic record that you formally did research, but assuming you did a good enough job, professors are fairly lenient on grading, so it’s a nice way of possibly boosting your GPA. <br>

<b>Time Commitment:</b><br>
If you choose to do research during the academic year, be aware that most labs ask students to allocate 12-15 hours a week so keep in mind your other commitments before deciding if this is something you want to do. While there are many students that only choose to engage in research during the summer, the positive aspect of working at a lab continuously is the opportunity to get your name published in a paper. <br>

Specifics to different fields: <br>
Engineering: <br>
Tons of research positions can be found for all engineering majors here. 
Computer Science: <br>
Add yourself to the CS listservs. Email Remi Moss at remimoss@cs.columbia.edu to have yourself added!
In the beginning of each semester, the CS Department has a research symposium where the current projects going on our presented. The best way to get research is to attend this and follow up with a project you really liked.
Social Sciences:<br>
For research positions in the social sciences, you would also send out emails to professors whose research interests are similar to yours. Sometimes, professors will announce in class if they or their fellow faculty members are seeking work-study student assistants. Usually, you’d start out as an Administrative Assistant and then professors would ask you to help them with research. You can also ask your professors if they are seeking work-study students or if they know other professors in the department who are. 
Sciences:<br>
For research positions in the sciences, it is easier to sign up for listservs that announce positions for labs, especially the pre-med listserv or biology department announcements.
You might also want to attend events during the semester with open lab positions in the chemistry, biology, engineering, or neuroscience department. 
You might also find it helpful to reach out to your advising dean or major advisor (if you are majoring in the sciences). 
If you have taken classes and know what kind of research you want to engage in, there are plenty of labs and places around NYC that might offer you a position if you first start by reaching out and e-mailing professors or investigators. However, many times you might not get a response from professors or labs in Columbia. Do not fear, there are plenty of other places to look for research positions like the medical center uptown as well as other universities and institutions around the area (NYU, Barnard, Columbia Medical Center, Iving Cancer Institute, etc). New York might be very competitive, especially with the amount of students trying to get into a lab, but there are plenty of opportunities if you choose to seek them, so please don’t be discouraged if you don’t get a response right away. <br>
If you are lucky to attain a position, most students start by volunteering (or it becomes part of their work-study) before choosing to stay during the summer and getting academic credit the following year. This will allow you to get acquainted with the research as well as learn lab techniques involved. Keep in mind that you will most likely be working with a PhD student and not the principal investigator itself. Although you might not get paid during your summer research or volunteer work, establishing a mentor connection becomes invaluable. Columbia offers grants through the alumni association for non-paid science research.
Clinical Research:<br>
Also, for pre-meds or psychology students who don’t like scientific lab work, there are plenty of hospitals in New York to engage in clinical research. This is a different area of research where you are involved more with the patients. You may also get credit for this kind of research listed under the biology classes.<br>

Sample Emails:<br>

Hi Professor _________,<br>

My name is Lesley Cordero and I'm a sophomore undergraduate student in Columbia's School of Engineering. I'm currently studying Computer Science and am inquiring about a possible research opportunity in your laboratory. [Side Comment: It’s very important that you introduce yourself, your school standing, major, and why you’re emailing them right off the bat]<br>

This semester I have been taking Computer Science Theory (COMS 3261) and have enjoyed the course so much so that I'm strongly considering the Foundations track. With that said, I have a strong interest in this Computer Science theory, so researching topics like Game Theory and Computational Economics deeply interest me. [Side Comment: Be specific and as genuine as possible in your reasoning for wanting to work in your lab- professors want people who are interested in their research because those are the people most likely to make a solid contribution. Being too vague won’t really get you anywhere.] I have previous experience in data analysis, database development, and web development, through previous work experience and extra-curricular involvement. [Side Comment: Brief commentary on your skills- enough to get them the big picture, but small enough that they won’t get annoyed since you’ll be attaching your resume] Most importantly, I'm a very motivated student with a strong desire to learn, so if you find that I have any gaps in knowledge, please let me know- I have no problem doing my own learning prior to starting a research position with you in order to be adequately prepared. [Side Comment: Let them know what makes you awesome. Also, offering to learn material on your own shows you’re not only dedicated, but you’re in it for more than just a resume builder]<br>

With that said, I'm currently looking for a summer research position with the possibility of continuing onto the next academic years to come. [Side Comment: Don’t lie if you’re not interested in a long-term commitment, but if you are, let them know. Professors love to keep students around for a long period of time.] Would it be possible to have a quick chat about this, assuming space is available in your lab? [Side Comment: Asking to meet with them further shows you’re genuinely interested] I will be on campus all through Spring Break and afterwards, so anytime over the next weeks is fine by me. If so, please let me know. Lastly, in case an opening is still available, I have attached my resume to this email. [Side Comment: Always attach your resume.]<br>

Best,<br>

Barnard-Specific Advice and Resources:<br>

Research at Barnard is, for the most part, a different experience from doing research at Columbia. Both research have their pros and cons, and it really depends on you which one you’d like to do - there’s no loss in picking one or the other! Contrary to popular belief, Columbia students have and continue to do research with Barnard professors. So without further ado…<br>

Research at Barnard
Research at Columbia
work directly with professors
typically recommends that you take certain classes to do research
paid or for credit; “volunteering” is not common/nonexistent
students usually get their own research project; more direct work
most students are funded in some way or another, and this requires some type of research presentation at the end of the semester/summer

work with PhD students and/or Post Docs
can work as a volunteer
typically not strict with which classes you have taken - as long as you are willing to learn/listen to instructions
independency/dependency depends on the PhD/post doc you are working with
opportunities for publication, again, depending on PhD/post-doc and research progress

As mentioned, most, if not all, research at Barnard is paid. Here are some funding opportunities:

Con Edison Summer Internships in Science: http://barnard.edu/cd/students/funding/specialized/coned
Applications are accepted early spring and summer;
$1050 for a semester of research, or $4200 for summer with housing
Requires a poster/powerpoint presentation at the end of each semester/summer of funding
Research lab/internship MUST be located in NYC

Barnard Summer Research Institute
http://barnard.edu/summer-research-institute
Summer research; applications accepted late spring

Housing is included; stipend amount varies

Alumnae and Donor Sponsored Internship Grant:
http://barnard.edu/cd/students/funding/internship-grants
Applications accepted early fall, spring, and summer
$800 during the semester, or $2000 for summer with housing (if at NYC)
Research lab/internship can be located anywhere<br>
